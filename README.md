# Aptamer-Prediction-Data

This repository provides a comprehensive dataset for RNA Aptamer structure prediction, supporting research and development in computational biology and bioinformatics. The dataset includes original RNA aptamer structures obtained from the NAKB database and additional files generated through manual processing and structure prediction software. It is designed to facilitate the study and prediction of RNA aptamer tertiary structures.This repository contains data relevant to **RNA Aptamer structure prediction**. The dataset is structured and documented to ensure accessibility and usability.

## Key Features

1. **Comprehensive Aptamer Data**:  
   Includes original aptamer structure files sourced from **NAKB** (e.g., `5KPY.pdb` and `9BUN.pdb`) and manually generated aptamer prediction data.  

2. **Multi-Format Support**:  
   Offers datasets in formats suitable for tertiary structure analysis and visualization, including **PDB** and **PNG**.  

3. **Structure Prediction Results**:  
   Features tertiary structure predictions derived from secondary structure prediction software, aiding comparative studies of prediction accuracy and reliability.  

4. **Clear Documentation**:  
   The dataset is organized systematically, and file naming conventions facilitate straightforward navigation and understanding.
